# SALES-PREDICTION-SYSTEM-
Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of the global market, social media has become a powerful platform for marketers to extend their reach. This project focuses on predicting sales based on social network ads, with a specific emphasis on YouTube advertising. The objective is to decipher the impact of social media marketing on sales and optimize business strategies accordingly.

Prerequisites
Before getting started with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python: The project is implemented using Python, so make sure you have it installed on your machine.
Pandas: Used for data structure handling.
NumPy: Essential for linear algebra and mathematical operations.
Seaborn: Utilized for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Recommended for running the project interactively.

Preprocessing
To conduct experiments, datasets from the UCI machine learning repository (e.g., Facebook Ads and Sales, YouTube Ads and Sales) were employed for predicting social network ads and sales. The preprocessing phase involved leveraging Pandas for data structure handling, NumPy for linear algebra and mathematics, and Seaborn for data visualization.

Data Visualization
Data visualization serves as a pivotal technique to analyze trends, outliers, and patterns within the provided datasets. By visually representing the data, this approach facilitates data-driven decision-making.

Model Building
Understanding relationships within the data is crucial for effective model building. The project utilized a correlation matrix to guide this process. Linear Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was chosen to predict values based on independent variables and establish relationships for forecasting.

Training and Validation
The project employed Linear Regression for training and validation. This supervised learning algorithm aimed to establish relationships between variables and make predictions based on the input dataset.

Evaluation
The evaluation phase involved scrutinizing the disparities between actual and predicted prices. This was visualized through predicted vs. actual values, residual plots, and an in-depth analysis of residual errors.

Conclusion
The project proposes the utilization of the Linear Regression algorithm with Deep Learning Techniques for sales prediction. Implementation was carried out using Python open-source software. Results analysis indicated that YouTube prediction using the proposed method was considered the most effective among various datasets. This approach positively impacted sales factors, profitability, and consumer considerations.

Future Scope
The proposed work can be extended by refining social network ads and sales prediction using multiple datasets simultaneously. The application of Linear Regression with deep learning techniques can be further enhanced to provide high accuracy and prevent social media dataset loss. The future scope encompasses diverse applications in fields like stock marketing, bitcoin value prediction, and other business sectors.
